# CRT-OSMC, an EmulationStation theme with video support
A simple theme for Emulation Station and RetroPie with support for the video view added by fieldofcows. Originally based on the Carbon theme by Eric Hettervik; and then rebuilt from scratch. Forked for aesthetic changes to match OSMC. Discussion ongoing in this thread: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/7022/new-theme-crt-with-support-for-video-preview

## Details

- Has support for system, basic, detailed and video views
- Displays the following metadata on detailed and video views: rating, description, # of players, genre, publish date & last played
- Matching splashscreens are included in the \_inc/images folder
- 16x9 layout Tested on 720p and 1080p resolutions
- 4x3 layout tested on 480p/480i resolutions

## How to use

- Requires a Pi2/3 (videos are very choppy on a Pi0/1)
- Install latest version of retropie through the setup script (versions after 4.1.8 work)
- Add <video> elements to your gamelist to reference videos for each game on your pi (videos can be stored anywhere just like images)
